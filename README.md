# alarmSPA

1. I have used the HTML and CSS from the assignment page only, as this was focused on JS mainly.
2. I have used JS/jQuery for this assignment.
3. Made an SPA alarm application by purely using JS.
4. Attempted Clock, Add Alarm, list Alarm and active Alarm. Out of which Active alarm is not fully attempted.
